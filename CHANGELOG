Change Log

ver 0.1.0
First version.

ver 0.1.1
Cleaned up some code, no real bugs to work on.

ver 0.1.2
Noticed that some INI files were being treated poorly and not parsing correctly.  Rewrote
major parts of the code to treat all INI files correctly.  I also didn't like how the class
rewrote the INI file right away.  Don't know why I had it do that, but now it waits until
the class is closed.  I also added an option that can override the AutoSave.

ver 0.1.3
Apparently in my rewrites, I didn't give the ability to fill some of the variables right
away.  Fixed that.
