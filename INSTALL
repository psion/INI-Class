Installation of INI-Class is simple.  Just put the one and only PHP file in the directory
that you have your program in.  If you want to use it for more than just one script, put
it in your include directory.  Then from there, you can call it as a class.

Class Name: parseINI(ini file name)

Methods:

parseArray(array[optional) -   Pass an array in the correct structure and it will structure
                               it into an INI file string.  If none is given, then the basic
                               array from the class would be parsed.
parseString(string[optional) - Pass an INI file as a string through here and it will parse
										 it into an array.  If none is given, the INI file passed 
										 when the class was called will be parsed.
saveINI(string[optional]) -	 This will save the INI string.  If no string is passed, then
										 it will save the original INI string.
iniopt(option,value) - 			 This takes the options listed below.  Each option is a constant
									    with a default value.

There is one option currently, and that is the autosave.  The system automaticly saves the
modified INI string back to the original file.  Setting this option will override that.

Option:
INI_AUTOSAVE   1 - Autosave on (default)
               2 - Autosave off
										 
The array structure is listed in the README file.  It should be easy from there.
