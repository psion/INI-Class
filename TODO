To Do List

1.  The construct function is not exactly to my liking.  It rewrites the INI file
    the moment it reads it in.  I don't like that.  When I get the chance, I'm going
    to rewrite it to NOT do this.
2.  I don't know any thing else that really needs to be done here, maybe clean up the
    code.
